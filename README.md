This project is a deep dive into the world of network programming. I developed this real-time chat application to gain hands-on experience with Java's socket API and multi-threading concepts. The application is a great example of how a client-server model works in practice, handling communication and user management on a fundamental level.

What I Learned:

🌐 Networking Fundamentals: Gained a solid understanding of sockets, ports, and IP addresses.

🧵 Concurrency: Implemented threads to handle multiple client connections without blocking the server.

🔒 Connection Handling: Learned how to manage client connections, including graceful disconnections.

📦 Data Streaming: Gained experience with InputStreams and OutputStreams for data exchange.
