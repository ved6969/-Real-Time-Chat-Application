Project Title: Java-based Chat Application

Description: Developed a real-time chat application using Java and socket programming, implementing both client-server architecture and message exchange protocols. The application utilizes Java's networking libraries to establish communication between multiple clients and a central server. Key features include message broadcasting, user connection handling, and real-time interaction. This project enhanced my skills in network programming, multithreading, and understanding the principles of distributed systems.

Key Technologies & Skills:

Languages: Java
Networking: Sockets, Java NIO (Non-blocking I/O)
Architecture: Client-Server model
Key Concepts: Multithreading, message broadcasting, data serialization
Tools & Libraries: Java Networking API, Thread Management, Exception Handling
Learning Outcomes:

Gained hands-on experience in building scalable, real-time applications
Deepened understanding of socket communication, thread synchronization, and handling network connections
Enhanced problem-solving skills for managing multiple clients in concurrent environments
